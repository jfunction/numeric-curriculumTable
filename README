#The prototype works in about 2-3 steps.			###
#								###
#First, and you can skip this, run step1.py to generate 	###
#list.xml							###
#	step1 is versatile and can easily be modified to 	###
#	download playlists written in a data file		###
#	(say, via server update once a week)			###
#	or perhaps you want to fetch/build playlist lists on	###
#	the fly using the Khan API... etc...			 ###
#								  ###
#Second, upload index.php, process.php, list.xml and maketable.js
#	to your website (must support php, usually not a pain though)
#
#Third, open index php, and give it a whirl... :)
#
#Obviously it's just an initial prototype, could be made prettier... #The coding could do with another look too...
